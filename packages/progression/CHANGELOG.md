# @flare-engine/progression

## 0.4.5

### Patch Changes

- 8814ec2: Public release: every `@flare-engine/*` package is public on npm from this version, published from
  CI with npm provenance. No code changes; npm visibility is retroactive, so earlier versions are
  public too.
- Updated dependencies [8814ec2]

### Minor Changes

- 7c4f7cf: Packaging polish across all shipping manifests. Every package now declares `engines: { "node": ">=20" }`. Each package's `exports["."]` carries per-condition type declarations — ESM consumers (`import`) resolve `./dist/index.d.mts` and CommonJS consumers (`require`) resolve `./dist/index.d.ts`, so the declaration file always matches the resolved module format instead of an ESM import falling back to the CJS-flavored `.d.ts` (the `"."`-level `types` that previously shadowed the ESM condition is removed; the root `types` field is retained for legacy/`node10` resolution). The `@types/react` dev floor moves from `^18` to `^19` across the React-facing packages, matching the installed React 19 runtime. No runtime or public API surface changes.
- 376969a: Build toolchain modernized across all packages, with no runtime or public API changes. Every package is now bundled with `tsdown` (Rolldown-based, replacing the unmaintained `tsup`); dist output (`.js`/`.mjs`/`.d.ts`/`.d.mts` + sourcemaps) is byte-compatible, so `exports` maps and installed shape are unchanged. Lint runs on Biome 2, the TypeScript floor moves to 5.9 (with `erasableSyntaxOnly`, `noUncheckedSideEffectImports`, and `moduleDetection: "force"` added as guards), and Bun ambient types are removed from the shipped-source typecheck. The `@flare-engine/engine` README now documents that the engine is architecture-agnostic and imposes no React Native New Architecture requirement of its own.
- 8696136: README truth pass (foundation + runtime + systems tiers): every `ts`/`tsx` example now typechecks against the workspace (enforced by `bun run check:readme`), api-specs links are absolute (resolve on npmjs.com), and private-game references are removed.

  - Snippets corrected to the real API where they had drifted: `SeededRNG.float(min, max)`; `defineComponent(name, () => defaults)`; `postfx` `create*` factories are `(id, uniforms)`; `render` `drawSprite`/`SpriteColor`; `loadCanvasKit(wasmUrl)`; `CollisionPair.entityA/entityB` + `createCollider(shape, opts)`; `events` `EventMap`-satisfying maps; `audio` `AudioContextLike`.
  - `storage`: the migration example now preserves player data across a version bump (was discarding it); the native MMKV adapter is shown as a structural peer (no `react-native-mmkv` dependency claim).
  - `render-web`: presentation uses the real `kit.MakeWebGLCanvasSurface(...)` rather than a placeholder duck-type.
