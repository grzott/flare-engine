### Minor Changes

- ff62507: Peer-dependency floor bump + Skia decoupling across the React-facing packages, plus a new web frame-renderer export. Floors move to `react >=19` and `react-native >=0.79` (Skia 2.x requires RN 0.79, not 0.78) wherever those peers are declared. `@shopify/react-native-skia` moves to `>=2.0.0` where it is still required (`react`, `engine`), is dropped entirely as a peer from `render` and `assets` (both already inject a structural `*Like` Skia module and never import Skia), and becomes an **optional, type-only** peer of `shapes` (used only for the `import type` in `draw.ts`) and an **optional, injected** peer of `postfx` (Skia is passed in at runtime; the floor moves from `>=1.0.0` to `>=2.0.0`). `react-native-gesture-handler` is dropped as a peer from `input`, `react`, and `engine` (no runtime usage). `engine` gains `react-native-safe-area-context >=4.0.0` as a required peer, matching `<GameView>`'s inset resolution.

  `@flare-engine/render-web` additionally ships `createWebFrameRenderer(kit: CanvasKit): FrameRenderer` — the web/CanvasKit analog of `@flare-engine/react`'s `createSkiaFrameRenderer`, a thin composition `createFrameRenderer(createWebSkiaModule(kit))`; presentation (replaying `endFrame()` onto a surface and flushing) stays the consumer's responsibility. Also fixes the `render-web` on-screen post-FX surface so `resize()` correctly rebuilds the WebGL onscreen surface (`postfx-surface.ts`), preventing a stale-size onscreen target after a canvas resize.

- 7c4f7cf: Packaging polish across all shipping manifests. Every package now declares `engines: { "node": ">=20" }`. Each package's `exports["."]` carries per-condition type declarations — ESM consumers (`import`) resolve `./dist/index.d.mts` and CommonJS consumers (`require`) resolve `./dist/index.d.ts`, so the declaration file always matches the resolved module format instead of an ESM import falling back to the CJS-flavored `.d.ts` (the `"."`-level `types` that previously shadowed the ESM condition is removed; the root `types` field is retained for legacy/`node10` resolution). The `@types/react` dev floor moves from `^18` to `^19` across the React-facing packages, matching the installed React 19 runtime. No runtime or public API surface changes.
- 376969a: Build toolchain modernized across all packages, with no runtime or public API changes. Every package is now bundled with `tsdown` (Rolldown-based, replacing the unmaintained `tsup`); dist output (`.js`/`.mjs`/`.d.ts`/`.d.mts` + sourcemaps) is byte-compatible, so `exports` maps and installed shape are unchanged. Lint runs on Biome 2, the TypeScript floor moves to 5.9 (with `erasableSyntaxOnly`, `noUncheckedSideEffectImports`, and `moduleDetection: "force"` added as guards), and Bun ambient types are removed from the shipped-source typecheck. The `@flare-engine/engine` README now documents that the engine is architecture-agnostic and imposes no React Native New Architecture requirement of its own.
- 8696136: README truth pass (foundation + runtime + systems tiers): every `ts`/`tsx` example now typechecks against the workspace (enforced by `bun run check:readme`), api-specs links are absolute (resolve on npmjs.com), and private-game references are removed.

  - Snippets corrected to the real API where they had drifted: `SeededRNG.float(min, max)`; `defineComponent(name, () => defaults)`; `postfx` `create*` factories are `(id, uniforms)`; `render` `drawSprite`/`SpriteColor`; `loadCanvasKit(wasmUrl)`; `CollisionPair.entityA/entityB` + `createCollider(shape, opts)`; `events` `EventMap`-satisfying maps; `audio` `AudioContextLike`.
  - `storage`: the migration example now preserves player data across a version bump (was discarding it); the native MMKV adapter is shown as a structural peer (no `react-native-mmkv` dependency claim).
  - `render-web`: presentation uses the real `kit.MakeWebGLCanvasSurface(...)` rather than a placeholder duck-type.

- 2736317: Keyboard input + UI focus driver. `@flare-engine/input` adds `createKeyboard` / `attachKeyboardListeners` (buffered `isDown`/`wasPressed`/`wasReleased` edges, blur clears held keys) + a `KeyBindings` action resolver; keyboard state + binding are platform-neutral (mobile + web) with `keyDown`/`keyUp` injection. `@flare-engine/ui` adds `createFocusKeyboardDriver` — arrows/Tab move focus, Enter/Space activate, via the reactive FocusManager.

### Patch Changes

- d032b4b: physics adds broadphaseSize accessor + fixes the duplicate-broadphase-record leak on re-add (add() now routes to spatial.update when the entity already exists); input accumulates pointer delta across a frame instead of overwriting, matching the per-frame-delta contract.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- Remove phantom `@flare-engine/*` dependencies that were declared in `package.json` but never imported from source (packaging hygiene; no runtime or API change). A new `check:deps` CI guardrail enforces that declared dependencies match actual imports and that the graph stays strictly downward-only.
