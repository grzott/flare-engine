# @flare-engine/cli

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- ddbb151: both CLIs report their real version read from their own package.json at build time (no more hardcoded 0.0.0); Windows spawn uses shell:isWin with a validated app-name guard against injection; tiled-to-flare default out path now writes beside the input instead of a double-prepended absolute path that ENOENT'd without -o; --no-embed-tilesets preserves the external tileset source reference instead of emitting an empty zero stub.
- 7c4f7cf: Packaging polish across all shipping manifests. Every package now declares `engines: { "node": ">=20" }`. Each package's `exports["."]` carries per-condition type declarations — ESM consumers (`import`) resolve `./dist/index.d.mts` and CommonJS consumers (`require`) resolve `./dist/index.d.ts`, so the declaration file always matches the resolved module format instead of an ESM import falling back to the CJS-flavored `.d.ts` (the `"."`-level `types` that previously shadowed the ESM condition is removed; the root `types` field is retained for legacy/`node10` resolution). The `@types/react` dev floor moves from `^18` to `^19` across the React-facing packages, matching the installed React 19 runtime. No runtime or public API surface changes.
- 376969a: Build toolchain modernized across all packages, with no runtime or public API changes. Every package is now bundled with `tsdown` (Rolldown-based, replacing the unmaintained `tsup`); dist output (`.js`/`.mjs`/`.d.ts`/`.d.mts` + sourcemaps) is byte-compatible, so `exports` maps and installed shape are unchanged. Lint runs on Biome 2, the TypeScript floor moves to 5.9 (with `erasableSyntaxOnly`, `noUncheckedSideEffectImports`, and `moduleDetection: "force"` added as guards), and Bun ambient types are removed from the shipped-source typecheck. The `@flare-engine/engine` README now documents that the engine is architecture-agnostic and imposes no React Native New Architecture requirement of its own.
- abdb991: README truth pass (ui / integration / tooling tiers): every `ts`/`tsx` example now typechecks against the workspace (enforced by `bun run check:readme` — all 41 packages green) and api-specs links are absolute.

  - Snippets corrected to the real API: `ui` `Button` takes `label` (not children); `react` `<VirtualJoystick onStateChange={…}>` inside a component (the empty-arrow parse error is gone); `devtools` `DevtoolsProvider` requires `snapshot`/`world`/`loop` and `useEntityInspector` exposes `entities` (not `components`); `testing` demonstrates the utility without the unavailable `expect` global; `ui-shop`/`iap`/`achievements` declare their context/store/gate placeholders with the real exported types (`NoopIAPProvider`, `AchievementsStore`, `canAccessContent`).
  - `create-flare-app` (private) had its showcase link pointed at flareengine.dev.

  (Root `README.md`/`CONTRIBUTING.md` also updated — status block to the 0.3.0 lockstep/October public flip, restricted-npm section removed, lockstep versioning story, flarerpg.org disambiguation, stub→shipping honesty for the tier-2 + haptics rows — but those are repo-root docs, not shipped in any tarball.)
